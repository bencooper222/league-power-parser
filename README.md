# league-power-parser

This repo provides files to parse multiple league sites for champion power. Pick your favorite site and the corresponding `*.prod.js` file, paste it into the console of that site (see links to proper sites below) and get your results!

## Sites

- U.gg: https://u.gg/lol/tier-list/
- (DEPRECATED}Champion.gg: http://champion.gg/statistics/?league=gold#?sortBy=general.winPercent&order=descend
- (DEPRECATED) Op.gg: http://na.op.gg/statistics/champion/

The code for the deprecated sites will probably work but I won't be actively maintaining them. IMO u.gg is good enough that they're not needed.

## Example

Pretend the `*.prod.js` file is the Gist in the video https://www.useloom.com/share/a7f0773a37004827adacc264d80521d0
